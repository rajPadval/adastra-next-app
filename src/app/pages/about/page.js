          A bunch of students formed this club to enrich the engineering journey
          while also providing platforms, knowledge and resources to our
          audience. We organize events, promote them, share them and learn from
          them. Itâ€™s that simple. Our team consists of technically sound
          engineers, creative graphic designers, content writers, and marketing
          gurus, among many others. Each one of which contributes towards a fun
          cause and simultaneously builds themselves.
